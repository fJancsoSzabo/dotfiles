# Felix's dotfiles: a.k.a. configure.all()

Very early stage dotfiles, currently focusing on Ubuntu.  The goal is to configure *everything*, from packages to sublime text and shell configuration to system themes.

## Inspiration

### [holman's dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)

Zach Holman's dotfiles were the first ones I looked at seriously, and I've borrowed a bunch of code as well as the general layout from him.  They're absolutely fantastic, so check them out!

### [Adam Eivy's dotfiles](https://github.com/atomantic/dotfiles)

The genesis of my "configure everything" approach.  Comes with an adorable bot too!

## Installation
<pre>
git clone git@github.com:fJancsoSzabo/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles && ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
</pre>
